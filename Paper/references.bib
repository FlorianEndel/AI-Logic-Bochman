	abstract = {Many of the decisions we make, in trivial as well as in crucial matters, depend on the apparent likelihood of events such as the keeping of a promise, the success of an enterprise, or the response to an action. In general, we do not have adequate formal models to compute the probabilities of such events. Consequently, most evaluations of likelihood are subjective and intuitive. The manner in which people evaluate evidence to assess probabilities has aroused much research interest in recent years, e.g. Edwards (1968), Slovic (1972), Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein (1975), Kahneman and Tversky (1973), and Tversky and Kahneman (1974). This research has identified different heuristics of intuitive thinking and uncovered characteristic errors and biases associated with them. The present paper is concerned with the role of causal thinking in the evaluation of evidence and in the judgment of probability.},

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation―each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking. He offers practical and enlightening insights into how choices are made in both our business and our personal lives―and how we can use different techniques to guard against the mental glitches that often get us into trouble. Topping bestseller lists for almost ten years, Thinking, Fast and Slow is a contemporary classic, an essential book that has changed the lives of millions of readers.},

We searched for and screened 1,170 articles from 18 high-profile journals (65 per journal) published from 2010-2019. Based on written framing and systematic guidance, 3 reviewers rated the degree of causality implied in abstracts and full text for exposure/outcome linking language and action recommendations. Reviewers rated the causal implication of exposure/outcome linking language as none (no causal implication) in 13.8\%, weak in 34.2\%, moderate in 33.2\%, and strong in 18.7\% of abstracts. The implied causality of action recommendations was higher than the implied causality of linking sentences for 44.5\% or commensurate for 40.3\% of articles. The most common linking word in abstracts was "associate" (45.7\%). Reviewers' ratings of linking word roots were highly heterogeneous; over half of reviewers rated "association" as having at least some causal implication. This research undercuts the assumption that avoiding "causal" words leads to clarity of interpretation in medical research.},

	abstract = {Written by one of the pre-eminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Pearl presents a unified account of the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual and structural approaches to causation, and devises simple mathematical tools for analyzing the relationships between causal connections, statistical associations, actions and observations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard curriculum of statistics, artifical intelligence, business, epidemiology, social science and economics. Students in these areas will find natural models, simple identification procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have tended to evade or make unduly complicated. This book will be of interest to professionals and students in a wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.

	abstract = {The purpose of this note is to draw attention to certain aspects of causal reasoning which are pervasive in ordinary discourse yet, based on the author's scan of the literature, have not received due treatment by logical formalisms of common-sense reasoning. In a nutshell, it appears that almost every default rule falls into one of two categories: expectation-evoking or explanation-evoking. The former describes association among events in the outside world (e.g., fire is typically accompanied by smoke); the latter describes how we reason about the world (e.g., smoke normally suggests fire). This distinction is consistently recognized by people and serves as a tool for controlling the invocation of new default rules. This note questions the ability of formal systems to reflect common-sense inferences without acknowledging such distinction and outlines a way in which the flow of causation can be summoned within the formal framework of default logic.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach to token-level causal reasoning that we call Causal Logic Models ({CLMs}). A {CLM} is a ﬁrst-order representation that allows one to produce token-level causal explanations or predictions in domains which are too vast to generate a complete causal model. {CLMs} produce explanations/predictions as a dynamic sequence of mechanisms ({SoMs}) that chain together to propagate causal inﬂuence through time. We argue that explanations/predictions of this form are more fundamental than explanations that involve likely states of variables in conjunction with a complete causal model. We compare this approach to the causal explanations of Halpern and Pearl [2005], and show that even on relatively simple realworld physical systems, their method of generating explanations can quickly become intractable. We argue that the {SoMs} approach is qualitatively closer to the human causal reasoning process, and that for many real problems in {AI} such as diagnosing why a robot is stuck, {CLMs} provide more tractable and informative explanations.},

We define Causal Logic Models ({CLMs}), a new probabilistic, first-order representation which uses causality as a fundamental building block. Rather than merely converting causal rules to first-order logic as various methods in Statistical Relational Learning have done, we treat the causal rules as basic primitives which cannot be altered without changing the system. We provide sketches of algorithms for causal reasoning using {CLMs}, preliminary results for causal explanation, and explore the significant differences between causal reasoning in {CLMs} and fixed causal graphs, including the non-locality of manipulation and the non-commutability between observation and manipulation.},

Then, we carve out the strengths and weaknesses of the two method families by benchmarking their performance when applied to binary data under a variety of different discovery contexts.
