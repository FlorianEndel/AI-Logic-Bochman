# A brief introduction to Causal Reasoning of Alexander Bochman

**Author: Florian Endel

This repository contains materials from a seminar presentation and paper examining Alexander Bochman's formal theory of causal reasoning, presented at the "Seminar Logics in AI" (Winter 2024/25) at the Artificial Intelligence Group (AGI), University of Hagen, Germany.


## Overview

The work explores Bochman's approach to causal reasoning, which provides a formal framework that:

- Unifies classical logical reasoning with causal inference
- Encompasses both Pearl's structural equation models and nonmonotonic reasoning
- Offers a novel perspective on causality through an inferentialist lens
